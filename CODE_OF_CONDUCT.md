## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards
of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct also applies to the use of AegisForge software:

* **Educational Use**: AegisForge is intended solely for educational purposes,
  security research, and authorized security testing
* **Ethical Hacking**: All security testing must be conducted ethically and with
  proper authorization
* **Responsible Disclosure**: Any security vulnerabilities discovered must be
  reported responsibly

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the project maintainers responsible for enforcement at
[INSERT CONTACT EMAIL].

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

## Security Research Code of Conduct

As a security education platform, AegisForge has additional ethical guidelines:

### Acceptable Security Research

* Using AegisForge vulnerabilities in controlled environments for learning
* Testing security concepts on your own systems or with authorization
* Sharing knowledge and teaching materials derived from AegisForge
* Reporting genuine vulnerabilities in AegisForge itself responsibly
* Creating educational content based on AegisForge scenarios

### Unacceptable Security Activities

* Using techniques learned from AegisForge to attack real systems without authorization
* Sharing or distributing malicious payloads or exploit code for malicious purposes
* Attempting to monetize or weaponize vulnerabilities for harmful purposes
* Conducting security testing without proper authorization or consent
* Violating computer fraud and abuse laws in any jurisdiction

### Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability in AegisForge itself:

1. **Do not** publicly disclose the vulnerability
2. Report it privately through GitHub Security Advisories or via email
3. Provide detailed information to help reproduce the issue
4. Allow reasonable time for the maintainers to address the issue
5. Work collaboratively with maintainers on a fix

INTERCEPTED COMMUNICATION - CLASSIFIED
=====================================

DATE: 2024-01-15
TIME: 14:32:17 UTC
SOURCE: Corporate Authentication Portal (10.0.0.42)
DESTINATION: Authentication Server (10.0.0.100)
PROTOCOL: HTTPS (TLS 1.3)

INCIDENT REPORT:
---------------

During a penetration testing engagement, our team discovered that the
target organization's authentication system uses RSA encryption to protect
login credentials in transit. However, a critical misconfiguration was
identified in their cryptographic implementation.

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:
------------------

The system developers opted to use RSA with a public exponent of e=3,
citing "performance optimization" as the rationale. This decision was
made to reduce computational overhead during the encryption process.

While it's true that smaller exponents can improve encryption speed,
this optimization comes at a severe security cost when not implemented
carefully.

VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT:
------------------------

RSA with e=3 is vulnerable to cube root attacks when the plaintext
message satisfies certain conditions. Specifically, if the message m
is small enough that m^3 < n (where n is the RSA modulus), then the
encryption does not benefit from the modular reduction that provides
RSA's security.

In such cases:
  c = m^3 mod n = m^3 (no wrapping)

An attacker can simply compute the cube root of c to recover m, without
needing to factor the modulus or break RSA's mathematical hardness.

YOUR MISSION:
------------

Analyze the provided public key and encrypted message. Determine if the
implementation is vulnerable and, if so, exploit the weakness to recover
the plaintext flag.

FILES PROVIDED:
--------------
1. public_key.pem - RSA public key
2. encrypted_flag.txt - Intercepted encrypted message

SECURITY IMPLICATIONS:
---------------------

This vulnerability demonstrates why cryptographic best practices must
be followed rigorously. The standard recommendation is to use e=65537
(0x10001), which provides a good balance between security and performance.

Good luck!

CHALLENGE INSTRUCTIONS
======================

OBJECTIVE:
Decode the intercepted message from Area 64 and find the hidden flag.

BACKGROUND:
You've intercepted a message from a mysterious facility called "Area 64".
The message contains an encoded access key that you need to decode.

KEY OBSERVATIONS:
1. The facility is called "Area 64" - this is your biggest clue!
2. The message mentions "encoding" not "encryption" - there's a difference
3. The sender says the method is "simple by design"
4. No complex encryption keys are mentioned

YOUR TASK:
1. Examine the encoded_message.txt file
2. Identify the encoding method used (hint: look at the challenge name!)
3. Decode the encoded string
4. Submit the flag in the format HQX{...}

LEARNING GOALS:
- Understand the difference between encoding and encryption
- Learn about Base64 encoding
- Practice using decoding tools

TOOLS YOU CAN USE:
- Command line: base64, echo, cat
- Python: base64 module
- Online tools: base64decode.org, etc.

Remember: Think about what "64" might mean in the context of encoding!

Good luck!

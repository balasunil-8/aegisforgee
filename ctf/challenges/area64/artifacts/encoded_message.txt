MESSAGE INTERCEPT BEGIN:

From: Area64_SecOps@classified.mil
To: Field_Agent_7734@classified.mil
Subject: Access Credentials - Project Cipher

Agent 7734,

Your access credentials for the Area 64 facility have been encoded
using our standard protocol. As you know, everything in Area 64
follows "the protocol."

Your encoded access key is:

SFFYe2I0czM2NF8xc19uMHRfZW5jcnlwdGkwbl82NGMwZDN9

Please decode this using the standard Area 64 method and present
it at the security checkpoint. Remember: Area 64's encoding is
simple by design - we don't need encryption for internal messages,
just a way to prevent casual observation.

The name "Area 64" should give you a hint about our encoding method.

Best regards,
Area 64 Security Operations

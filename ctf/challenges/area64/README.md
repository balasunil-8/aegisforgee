# AREA64 - Cryptography Challenge

## Challenge Information

- **Category:** Cryptography
- **Difficulty:** Beginner
- **Points:** 100
- **Author:** AegisForge Security Team

## Description

Our intelligence team intercepted a secret message from a mysterious facility known only as "Area 64". The message appears to be encoded, but our analysts believe it's not actually encrypted - just obscured using a common encoding technique.

The message references something called "Area 64" multiple times. Could this be a clue about how the message was encoded?

Your mission: Decode the intercepted message and find the hidden flag.

## What You'll Learn

- The difference between encoding and encryption
- How Base64 encoding works
- Why Base64 is used in real-world applications
- Basic command-line tools for decoding
- Python scripting for cryptography challenges

## Files Provided

- `artifacts/encoded_message.txt` - The intercepted message from Area 64
- `artifacts/instructions.txt` - Additional information about the challenge

## Hints

💡 The challenge name itself is a big clue!
💡 Base64 is a common encoding scheme used to represent binary data in text format
💡 Many programming languages and command-line tools can decode Base64

## Flag Format

The flag follows this format: `HQX{...}`

Good luck, and remember: encoding is NOT the same as encryption!

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Teach API1 BOLA (10 minutes)

1. Start: `python vulnshop.py`
2. Dashboard opens automatically
3. Click "Attack Demonstrations"
4. Scroll to "BOLA - Read Someone Else's Order"
5. Follow the steps with Postman
6. Show the vulnerable result (status 200)
7. Show the secure result (status 403)
8. Explain: "Server must check ownership"

### Example 2: Full Class Demo (60 minutes)

Follow the "60-Minute Lesson Plan" in the Teaching Guide tab:
- 0-5 min: Intro
- 5-15 min: Show dashboard live data
- 15-40 min: Pick 3 vulnerabilities to demo
- 40-50 min: Show and explain fixes
- 50-60 min: Q&A

### Example 3: Student Exercise

Challenge: "Can you find another way to exploit API5?"
- Students use dashboard as reference
- Try different requests in Postman
- Report findings

## 🔄 Comparing Versions

**See Vulnerabilities (Current):**
```bash
python vulnshop.py
```

**See How It's Fixed (For Reference):**
```bash
python secure_vulnshop.py
```

Compare the two - same attacks will be blocked in secure version!
